Calculation Groups is a set of calculation items created on Tabular Editor that are applied on top of existing DAX measures. 
With calculation groups we can easily create different functions for all different measures created on the Tabular Model that save a lot of time, for example, the creation of the different Time Intelligence functions, and now we have the ability to format each of the calculation items.
